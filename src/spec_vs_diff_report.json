  "summary": "The diff largely implements the requested premium theme refresh, centered layout, consistent button styling, and the default-bio + safe localStorage bio migration. However, it also introduces additional functional behavior (URL validation/toasts and social-link filtering/migrations) that goes beyond a pure visual/UX polish pass.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added outbound URL validation on link click with toast error messaging (security/injection prevention behavior).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest specifies “No new features… visual/UX polish pass only”; click-time URL blocking and new helper logic changes behavior beyond styling.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (handleLinkClick uses isValidOutboundUrl + toast error)",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions new isValidOutboundUrl helper for click-time validation)",
        "frontend/src/features/profile/validation.ts (referenced as adding isValidOutboundUrl)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Introduced/expanded toast notification system usage for share success/failure and invalid link URL.",
      "reason": "Toasts are functional UX behavior not explicitly requested; Share UX changes were not part of requirements.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (toast.success/toast.error in handleShare and handleLinkClick)",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (Toast.tsx described)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Automatically filters/removes Twitter/X and Instagram links from stored profile data and/or rendering, and adds a dedicated Instagram button behavior (beyond preserving URLs).",
      "reason": "Non-goals include “Adding new social networks or new outbound link types”; while not adding a new network, the automatic removal/cleanup of existing link rows and dedicated handling is a behavioral change not requested (and also risks changing user-configured links).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (filteredLinks filters out Twitter/X and Instagram)",
        "frontend/src/features/profile/useProfileLocalStorage.ts (cleanupSocialLinks removes Twitter/X and Instagram; Snapchat migration adds/normalizes Snapchat link)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Added a placeholder hook file (useQueries.ts) unrelated to the UI/UX profile landing page improvements.",
      "reason": "Not requested by the BuildRequest and not necessary for the specified UI polish scope.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts: Empty placeholder file)"
