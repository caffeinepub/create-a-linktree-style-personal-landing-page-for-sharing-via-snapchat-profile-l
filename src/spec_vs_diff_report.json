The dedicated Instagram button behavior (single button, label, and new-tab navigation) is not fully verifiable from the truncated App.tsx diff.",

      "reason": "The diff shows Instagram URL constant and filtering of Instagram links from profile.links, but the actual dedicated Instagram button/link markup (including target=\"_blank\" and ensuring exactly one visible Instagram-related button) is in truncated portions of App.tsx and is not directly evidenced.",
